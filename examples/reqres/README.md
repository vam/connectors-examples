# Connectors to reqres.in API

This very simple example illustrates a basic setup of connectors that connect to [https://reqres.in](reqres.in API). We create two connectors: `users` and `user`. The users connector connects to the list endpoint `api/users` and the user connector to the singe resource endpoint `api/users/{userId}`.

## Installation and Usage
```
$yarn install
$yarn start
```
